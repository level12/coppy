Minor: Adjust mise/uv Python bootstrap mechanism and install recommendations
  - If using centralized venvs, ensure ~/.cache/uv-venvs/ exists.  Project venvs will now be
    configured in that location.
  - If using the previous method of defining UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT in a mise config file, you
    should remove it.
  - The new init method which uses a custom task in the project and adjusted `mise.toml` config
    should "just work".  It's tested, but it's also new, so YMMV.
  - We now recommend installing uv directly as the OS user and not through Mise.
