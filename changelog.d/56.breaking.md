Moderate: Adjust mise/uv Python bootstrap mechanism and change install recommendations in docs.
  - If using centralized venvs, ensure `~/.cache/uv-venvs/` exists.  Project venvs will now be
    configured in that location.
  - The new init method which uses a custom task in the project and adjusted `mise.toml` config
    should "just work".  It's tested, but it's also new, so YMMV.
  - Docs: we now recommend installing uv directly as the OS user and not through Mise.
  - Remove `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` from `~/.config/mise/config.toml` which will be a breaking
    change for existing projects not updated to at least this version of the Coppy template.

    For existing projects that aren't ready to be updated, you should add the
    `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` definition to a project specific `mise.local.toml` file:

      ```toml
      [env]
      UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT = '{% if env.PROJECT_SLUG %}~/.cache/uv-venvs/{{ env.PROJECT_SLUG }}{% endif %}'
      ```

      When the project updates to at least this version of the Coppy template, that definition
      should be removed.
