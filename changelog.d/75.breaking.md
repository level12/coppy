Moderate: move project's tests from `./src` to `./tests`
  - Advantages: test directory is top-level and more obvious, provides more flexibility if wanting
    to test a generated wheel and not the code in `./src`.  See related issue for example.
  - Actions **required**: move `conftest.py` and your tests from `./src/` to `./tests`
