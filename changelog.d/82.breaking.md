Minor: change python dependency group and nox session name from "tests" to pytest.  Also, enhance
noxfile with improved `uv_sync()` and `pytest_run()`.
    - "tests" -> "pytest" dependency group: mostly for clarity.  While technically breaking, most
      projects won't need to manually change anything unless they've customized that group already.
    - The functions serve as a foundation for more complicated setups with multiple pytest runs,
      potentially using different environment variables, and paramiterization.  Example of such
      usage in Webgrid's [`noxfile.py`](https://github.com/level12/webgrid/blob/master/noxfile.py).
